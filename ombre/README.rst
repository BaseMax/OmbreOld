Ombre Under new development scheme
##################################
We believe every single contribution from every one should remains in the history.

Therefore every discussion will be remain safe and untouched.

To contribure to this project, you need just to learn how to use `git` ,  `restructuredtext` (rst), pull request and  of course a simple text editor like `geany <https://geany.org>`_ .

With this strategy we do not need to be dependent on any git host websites and we can migrate easily between them if they force us to do so 

For example see 
https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/236#issuecomment-419366720 
and 
https://twitter.com/whoisanonimal/status/1019360748491849728

By the help of `SadBatman <https://github.com/SadBatman>`_ and others, yoosofan <https://yoosofan.github.io/en/>`_ is trying to revive this coin under a new development scheme which we believe is more transparent and more community based.

We may use any kind of text based tools for all our work including wiki such that all of them can be put on the git repository.

Don't get your hopes up too much
################################
Apart from `Niels <https://github.com/SadBatman>`_ , which cannot unfortunately work much, the rest of us (core participants) are non developer or developer who weren't serious cryptocurrency developer.

At least me `yoosofan <https://github.com/yoosofan>`_  is not cryptocurrency developer right now but have more than two decades of developing variety of projects with different programming languages and familiar of managing projects, and of course teaching programming langauges.

So please be patient and help us to survive this coin as we intended.

We try as hard as we can to bring this coin up and not failed it, but remember that all of us have daily job to work on too.

These words are just like the rest of our work should be mentioned loudly because we want to be honest as much as possible. 
It does not mean wo do not take your business and your money seriously, it is fully against it because getting falsehood hopes and dreams are what we all hate!

Look at big coins with serious well known full time developer and how they fail what they claim. Unfortunately some coins are mostly shiling coins and using your emotions to get your money.

If you are here for `Lambo` or `Jambo` , non of them can be find here.
